    description: "The Volkswagen Nivus/Taigo is a subcompact crossover SUV (B-segment) with a sloping roofline built on the Volkswagen Group MQB A0 platform, shared with the Volkswagen Polo Mk6. The vehicle was first released as the Volkswagen Nivus, which was unveiled in May 2020 in Brazil, followed by launches in other South American markets in 2021. It was released in Europe in July 2021 as the Volkswagen Taigo. Positioned alongside the T-Cross in the European market and below it in South America, the Nivus/Taigo features a distinctive coupe-like design with a low-roof proportion that sets it apart from traditional SUVs. The vehicle is manufactured in Brazil (São Bernardo do Campo) for South American markets and in Spain (Pamplona) for the European market. It uses front-wheel drive exclusively, with no all-wheel drive option available. Engine options include the 1.0-liter TSI turbocharged three-cylinder (95 PS in Europe, 118 PS in South America) and the 1.5-liter TSI turbocharged four-cylinder (150 PS in Europe). Transmissions range from 5-speed and 6-speed manual to 6-speed automatic and 7-speed DSG options depending on market. The interior shares many components with the Polo, featuring a modern dashboard with digital instrument cluster and infotainment system. Cargo capacity is approximately 415 liters in the Nivus and 438 liters in the European Taigo. The vehicle successfully combines SUV practicality with distinctive coupe-inspired styling, appealing to style-conscious buyers seeking a unique alternative in the compact crossover segment."
